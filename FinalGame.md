This game is a two player pong game, where you use the keys "W" and "S" for the left paddle. The up and down arrows are used to control the paddle on the right side. To restart your game after a player scores, just hit the enter key.
I used conditionals to make sure that when you let go of the arrow, you paddle stops moving. Because without them the paddle wpuld just go up of down forever.
I used loops and arrays to make the ball always go to the left or the right of the screen. Also without tthe loops the ball would not bounce off a paddle and keep going, instead it would just sit there.
The objects I used in this game were; an ecclipse for the pong ball and rectangles for the paddles on the left and right.


Im going to be completly honest and say that I think this project only deserves an 80 out of 100, maybe even less. I think this because the game is not original at all, so many people before me have made it. Also its not very advandced, because there is no pictures and its just black on white.
